Rebuilding Website with Django Framework

At first this was intended to be all the code for the website but with the modern paradigm of Javascript frameworks,
I've separated the backend and the frontend into two repositories. This is the backend with a postgresql database.
No we don't need this much architecture for a simple website but this is rather to explore the latest advancements to
making a legit website.
